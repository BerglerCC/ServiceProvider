# ServiceProvider

USAGE

Import into visual studio and execute File->Export Template.
This wil create a template for you that you can use to create (un)installable en debugabble services.

I am not sure about the event in IWindowService
Seemed like a good idea, but maybe it's a little bit intrusive
